"""
- This simulation shows how brute-force time explodes with key length.
- Even though DES has a 56-bit effective key, hardware and distributed attack techniques were historically used to break it; this is why modern cryptography uses larger keys (AES-128/256).
- Use this tool to experiment with N values and observe timing differences.
