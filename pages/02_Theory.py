**DES basics**


- DES is a symmetric block cipher with 64-bit block size and a 56-bit effective key (stored across 8 bytes with parity bits).
- Keyspace size: 2^56 â‰ˆ 7.2058e16 keys.


**Brute-force**


- Brute-force means testing keys until the plaintext is recovered. Time grows linearly with keyspace size.
- This project uses a *toy* mode: it fixes a baseline 8-byte key and varies only the lowest *N* bits (so the keyspace is 2^N). This keeps the demo runnable.


**Why toy mode?**


- Full DES (2^56) cannot be exhaustively searched in reasonable time on a single laptop. Varying N between 8 and 24 shows exponential time growth clearly.
